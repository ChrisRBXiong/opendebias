# Introduction
-----
OpenDebias is a Debias framework for Natural Language Inference research with Pytorch. OpenDebias aims to accelerate research cycle in debias learning: from designing a new debias learning method to debias training a new model on new dataset with the exsiting debias learning methods. Key features include:

- **Reproducible implementation of SOTA in Debias**

- **Benchmark suite:**

- **Ease of Usability**

- **Modular:**Easy to design new tasks and reuse the existing components from other tasks (objective functions, model trunk and heads, data transforms, etc.). The modular components are simple drop-in replacements in jsonnet config files.
